    <h2>To the One I Let the Wind In</h2>
    <p>
     I had started to admire. Beneath the skies, I thought I had finally found a friend who is exactly like me.<br><br>
    I had started imagining convos, meetups. Why did I let my brain get drenched by your presence?<br><br>
    Now I feel empty. The call I had happily promised is just leaving behind an unmendable hole in me.<br><br>
    I am happy that you had the audacity to tell me. I am happy that you trusted.<br><br>
    But why do I feel like my heart is silently being betrayed in all the ventures it commits to?<br><br>
    I can't hold it in me anymore. I had allowed myself to let the wind in even when I knew it would destroy me.<br><br>
    Now why do I feel lonely again in this world full of people?<br><br>
    Why does it happen with everyone my heart chooses to?<br><br>
    My own expectations just hurt me.<br><br>
    But one thing I acknowledge, I am not in that intolerant pain anymore.<br><br>
    My life just loves to play jokes on me so that I can later think of it and laugh.<br><br>
    Wish I could hold a special position in you, but it doesn't exist anymore.<br><br>
    People are gonna love you because of your fame and you won't realize they are fake and you will leave me.<br><br>
    Later it will be too late to realize.<br><br>
